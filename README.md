I want to see the extra packages that I no longer want anymore, so I am making this!

# Usage

Probably a simple cargo run would make this work for you. You should not be installing this just yet with a non working config file.

```sh
cargo run
```

# TODO

- [x] Use toml file for stuff like settings and app selection
- [x] Actually display useful info
- [ ] Use clap
- [ ] Remove panics/unwraps to handle errors properly
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Testing
